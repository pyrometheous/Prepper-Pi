# Support Policy

This is a personal hobby project. There is no SLA or guaranteed turnaround time for questions, issues, or security reports.

- Best effort only for the latest commit and recent tagged releases.
- Please use GitHub Issues for general bugs/requests and Security Advisories for vulnerabilities.
- Commercial support is not offered at this time. For hardware licensing inquiries, use the “Commercial license inquiry” issue template.

Note: DIY/personal use is free under PP‑NC‑1.0. Selling preconfigured hardware or services that ship/market the Prepper‑Pi stack requires a commercial license with revenue share (see `docs/legal/COMMERCIAL-LICENSE.md`).
