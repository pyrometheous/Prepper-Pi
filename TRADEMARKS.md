# Prepper Pi Trademarks Policy

The "Prepper Pi" name, logo, and related branding ("Marks") are the property of the project author (pyrometheous). They are **not** licensed under the project's software or documentation licenses.

## Permitted Use (without permission)
- **Nominative fair use:** Truthful, limited phrases like "compatible with Prepper Pi" that do not imply endorsement.
- **Editorial/review use:** Screenshots or references in news, reviews, or documentation with proper attribution and no logo modification beyond size.

## Restricted Use (permission required)
You may **not** without written permission:
- Sell or market hardware/services using the Prepper Pi Marks.
- Use the Marks in company names, product names, domains, or social handles.
- Modify the logos or create confusingly similar marks.
- Imply endorsement, affiliation, or sponsorship by Prepper Pi.

## Third-Party Trademarks
All third-party names and logos (e.g., **Meshtastic**, **OpenWrt**, **Raspberry Pi**, **Jellyfin**, **Portainer**) are the property of their respective owners. Nothing in this project grants rights to use third-party marks. Follow each owner's branding/trademark policy.

## Requests
To request commercial use of Prepper Pi Marks (e.g., branded hardware), contact **pyrometheous** with product details and usage examples. Approvals may include brand guidelines and quality requirements.
