## About This Project

This suite helps you curate a small media library for the M.2 SSD on your **Prepper Pi** device. The goal is to build a compact, offline-accessible collection of public domain films and ebooks that can be stored locally and accessed without an internet connection.

## Overview

This suite contains Python scripts for downloading public domain media with built-in copyright protection measures:

### üìΩÔ∏è Public Domain Movies
Downloads verified public domain films from trusted sources like Internet Archive and Wikimedia Commons. See the **[Movies README](movies/README.md)** for complete details on usage, manifest format, and copyright safeguards.

### üìö Project Gutenberg Ebooks
Multiple options available for downloading Project Gutenberg's 70,000+ book catalog, including a self-hosted Docker solution for unlimited access. See the **[Gutenberg README](ebooks/GUTENBERG_README.md)** for setup guides and usage instructions.

**Important:** Project Gutenberg requires removal of their branding/boilerplate from redistributed content per their [trademark policy](https://www.gutenberg.org/policy/trademark_policy.html). This script handles that automatically, however you should **always** check the books yourself to validate that you are in compliance with the Project Gutenberg trademark policy.

### üìñ Standard Ebooks Library
Download the complete Standard Ebooks library (requires Patrons Circle membership). All editions are CC0 (public domain). See the **[Standard Ebooks README](ebooks/STANDARD_EBOOKS_README.md)** for details.

## Installation

```powershell
# Python 3.6 or higher required

**Note:** Movie downloader uses only Python standard library and requires no external dependencies.
