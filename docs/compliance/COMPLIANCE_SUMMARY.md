## üéØ Commercial Readiness Status

With these updates, the Prepper Pi project is now ready for commercial hardware sales provided the distributor:

1. Obtains commercial license from pyrometheous with revenue sharing agreement
2. Hosts source bundles at the specified URL for 3 years minimum  
3. Respects all trademark policies for both Prepper Pi and third-party marks
4. Ships without copyrighted media and lets users add their own content
5. Handles codec licensing appropriately for their target markets
6. Provides proper customer support and regulatory compliance

## üîß Usage Instructions

### For Commercial Distributors
1. Contact pyrometheous for commercial licensing agreement
2. Run `scripts/build-manifest.sh` before each release
3. Create a GitHub Release (fail the release if any item is missing) with:
   - the image/binary artifacts (if any),
   - the matching `source/` archive (Corresponding Source),
   - the generated `MANIFEST.txt`,
   - the checksums for all posted artifacts,
   - (optional but recommended) a `/licenses` folder inside the `source/` archive with license texts.
4. Include `licenses/THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md` with devices
5. Follow branding guidelines in `TRADEMARKS.md`

### For DIY Users
- All changes maintain free personal/educational use
- No additional requirements for DIY implementations
- Enhanced documentation for better understanding of components

## üì¨ Next Steps

The project maintainer should:
1. Ensure source bundles are published in GitHub Releases concurrent with any binary/image releases
2. Maintain the 3-year retention policy for tagged releases and source archives
3. Create branding guidelines document for commercial licensees
4. Test the build manifest script in the actual deployment environment
