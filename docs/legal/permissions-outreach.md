# Permissions outreach templates for upstream projects

This file provides ready-to-send subjects and bodies for asking about brand/trademark use or other permissions. Where no public email exists, a link to the official contact form or channel is provided with a pasteable message.

Notes
- Send from your personal email. Replace <Your Name> and add any extra links you want to share.
- Keep “no endorsement” language. Don’t imply affiliation.
- You normally don’t need permission to use FOSS under its license. These are courtesy/brand-use requests for clarity and goodwill, especially for commercial hardware sales or marketing.
- Project status: Prepper‑Pi’s own code is source‑available under PP‑NC‑1.0 (noncommercial), and docs are CC BY‑NC. That’s not OSI “open source.” Commercial hardware sales that ship or market the Prepper‑Pi stack require a separate commercial license with revenue share from the author; third parties may not commercialize the Prepper‑Pi code or a preconfigured distribution without such a license. GPL/LGPL obligations for included third‑party software will be honored via corresponding source distribution.

## Raspberry Pi (trademark/brand use)
- Recipient: Web form (no public email)
  - https://www.raspberrypi.com/contact/
  - Trademark rules: https://www.raspberrypi.com/trademark-rules/
- Subject (for the form): Request: trademark use for commercial hardware using Raspberry Pi
- Body:
  Hello Raspberry Pi team,

  I’m the maintainer of the Prepper‑Pi project (https://github.com/pyrometheous/Prepper-Pi), a small hardware kit intended for personal/off‑grid use. The kit uses genuine Raspberry Pi hardware, and I’d like to confirm approved ways to reference your brand in product documentation and marketing.

  Specifically:
  - Use of the phrase “for Raspberry Pi” or “compatible with Raspberry Pi” in product pages and instructions.
  - Whether I may participate in or qualify for “Powered by Raspberry Pi,” and any requirements.
  - Correct attribution lines (e.g., “Raspberry Pi is a trademark of Raspberry Pi Ltd”).
  - Any additional restrictions for paid kits (non‑subscription, one‑time purchase) where I make no claim of endorsement.

  I will follow your trademark rules, avoid logos unless licensed, and prominently include a no‑endorsement disclaimer. Please advise on the most appropriate license or approval path.

  Thank you,
  <Your Name>
