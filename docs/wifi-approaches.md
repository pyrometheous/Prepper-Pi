# WiFi AP Implementation Approaches

## Overview
Two approaches for implementing WiFi Access Point functionality on Raspberry Pi.

---

## Option 1: OpenWrt Container (feature/openwrt-container branch)

### Pros
- **Full-featured router OS** with extensive networking capabilities
- **LuCI Web UI** - Professional, well-tested admin interface
- **Captive portal** support (openNDS)
- **Advanced firewall** (firewall4/nftables)
- **Package management** for adding features
- **Familiar to network admins** who know OpenWrt

### Cons
- **ARM64 image availability** - Limited official support
- **Container complexity** - Running full router OS in container
- **Resource overhead** - Heavier than native approach
- **Hardware passthrough** challenges for WiFi devices
- **Host networking required** for AP mode

### Implementation Status
- Docker compose configuration exists
- Need to resolve ARM64 image availability
- May require custom image build

### Web UI Features
- LuCI provides full network configuration
- SSID, password, channel settings
- DHCP server configuration
- Firewall rules
- Port forwarding
- Traffic monitoring

## Option 2: Native hostapd/dnsmasq (feature/native-hostapd branch)

### Pros
- **Native Pi support** - Designed for Raspberry Pi hardware
- **Lightweight** - Minimal resource usage
- **Direct hardware access** - No container passthrough needed
- **Well-documented** - Extensive Pi community resources
- **Reliable** - Proven on millions of Pi devices

### Cons
- **No built-in web UI** - Need to add one
- **Less feature-rich** than OpenWrt out of the box
- **Manual configuration** initially
- **Custom development** for advanced features

### Implementation Options

#### A) With RaspAP Web UI (Recommended)
- **RaspAP** is a popular, mature web interface for Raspberry Pi AP
- Features:
  - WiFi configuration (SSID, password, channel, country)
  - DHCP server management
  - Network bridging
  - VPN client support
  - Bandwidth monitoring
  - Client management
  - Captive portal
  - Ad blocking (optional)
- Installation: Single command setup
- Resource usage: Very light (~50MB RAM)

#### B) Custom Lightweight UI
- Simple web interface (Flask/Node.js)
- Basic features: SSID, password, channel
- Minimal dependencies
- Good for learning/customization

#### C) Cockpit with NetworkManager
- System management tool with web UI
- Network configuration plugin
- Good for full system management
- More than just WiFi

### Implementation Plan for Native Approach
1. Install hostapd, dnsmasq, iptables
2. Configure AP with internet passthrough
3. Install RaspAP or custom UI
4. Set up captive portal (if needed)
5. Configure firewall rules

## Comparison Matrix

| Feature | OpenWrt Container | Native + RaspAP | Native + Custom UI |
|---------|------------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| Setup Complexity | High | Medium | Medium-High |
| Resource Usage | Heavy | Light | Very Light |
| Web UI Quality | Excellent (LuCI) | Good (RaspAP) | Basic |
| WiFi Hardware Support | Moderate | Excellent | Excellent |
| Internet Passthrough | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Captive Portal | ✅ (openNDS) | ✅ (nodogsplash) | ❌ (manual) |
| Advanced Firewall | ✅ | ✅ | Partial |
| VLAN Support | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |
| Package Management | ✅ (opkg) | ❌ | ❌ |
| Pi Integration | Moderate | Excellent | Excellent |
| Maintainability | Medium | High | Medium |

## Recommendation

**For Production: Native hostapd + RaspAP**
- More reliable on Pi hardware
- Better performance
- Easier to troubleshoot
- Good enough web UI for most use cases
- Proven track record on Pi

**For Advanced Features: OpenWrt Container**
- If you need advanced routing features
- If you want the full LuCI experience
- If you're comfortable building custom images
- If resource usage isn't a concern

## Next Steps

### OpenWrt Branch
1. Research ARM64 image availability
2. Test alternative image tags
3. Consider building custom image
4. Document image build process

### Native Branch
1. Remove OpenWrt container from compose
2. Add hostapd/dnsmasq installation to setup script
3. Integrate RaspAP installation
4. Configure internet passthrough
5. Test on actual Pi hardware
