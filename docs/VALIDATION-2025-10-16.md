# Repository Sync Validation - October 16, 2025

## Validation Summary

Compared the local repository (`C:\Users\Delgado\VSCode\Prepper-Pi`) with the working Pi configuration (copied to `C:\temp\prepper-pi\`) to ensure all tested changes are captured.

## Files Compared

### ✅ docker-compose.yml
**Status:** Already in sync (no differences)
- HOMEPAGE_ALLOWED_HOSTS environment variable present
- Configuration matches working Pi deployment

### ✅ scripts/captive-portal-setup.sh  
**Status:** Updated from Pi version (Pi had improvements)

**Key improvements from Pi version:**
- Better URL parsing with `urlparse` module
- Flexible detection with `'generate_204' in path` check
- Enhanced HTML redirect page (title, fallback link)
- Simplified HEAD request handling
- Additional detection domains:
  - `clients3.google.com`
  - `connecttest.txt`
- Better output messages and testing instructions

**Changes committed:** Yes (commit b72a989)

### ✅ Documentation Files
**Status:** New files created and committed

Added comprehensive deployment documentation:
- `docs/FRESH-DEPLOY-TEST.md` - Full testing guide with validation checklist
- `docs/QUICK-DEPLOY-CHECKLIST.md` - Quick reference for deployments
- `docs/DEPLOY-FIXES-NEEDED.md` - Known issues in first-run-setup.sh
- `docs/wifi-approaches.md` - WiFi configuration approaches

## Validation Results

### Files In Sync ✅
- `docker-compose.yml` - Matches Pi version exactly
- `scripts/captive-portal-setup.sh` - Now updated to match Pi improvements
- All other scripts - No differences detected

### Known Issues Documented ⚠️
- `scripts/first-run-setup.sh` contains old DNS wildcard hijacking
- See `docs/DEPLOY-FIXES-NEEDED.md` for details
- Will need to fix before fresh deploy testing

## Commits Made

1. **Commit f8d9833** (earlier)
   - Added HOMEPAGE_ALLOWED_HOSTS to docker-compose.yml
   - Updated captive-portal-setup.sh with DNS and firewall fixes

2. **Commit b72a989** (this validation)
   - Synced captive-portal-setup.sh with Pi improvements
   - Added comprehensive deployment documentation
   - Documented known issues

## Push Status

✅ Both commits pushed to `origin/feature/native-hostapd`

## Repository State

**Branch:** feature/native-hostapd  
**Remote:** Up to date with origin  
**Working Directory:** Clean (no uncommitted changes)

## Next Steps

Before fresh deploy testing:
1. ✅ Repository synced with working Pi configuration
2. ⬜ Fix `scripts/first-run-setup.sh` DNS wildcard issue
3. ⬜ Test fresh deployment following `docs/QUICK-DEPLOY-CHECKLIST.md`
4. ⬜ Validate all services work as expected
5. ⬜ Merge feature branch to main if successful

## Conclusion

✅ **Repository is now fully synchronized with the working Pi deployment**

All tested configurations from the Pi are captured in the repository. The captive-portal-setup.sh script includes all the improvements made during live testing. Fresh deploys using these scripts should produce the same working configuration.

One known issue remains: first-run-setup.sh needs updating to remove the DNS wildcard hijacking before it can work properly in a fresh deployment.
